# Mud Designer Home

The Mud Designer is a cross-platform game engine and set of flexible tools to developer and run M.U.D games.

### What is this repo
---
This repository is the home of the Mud Designer. The Mud Designer is being built from the ground up with extensibility support in mind. Meaning that the core engine is very light and is not responsible for most of the actual game. The game is made up of a series of nuget packages, with each package having their own repository here on Github. You can find all of the repositories associated to the Mud Designer below.
